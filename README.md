# MessageEncryptor
A Java Swing App that can take in text input for you and perform a keyword cipher based on a specified keyword. It also allows you to import whole text files and do the same thing.

MessageEncryptor allows you to take makes use of keyword ciphers to be able to encrypt messages that you directly type into the 
Single tab or that you import as a whole text file to encrypt with a keyword of your choice in the File Tab.

Please note that this program was built for fun and the encryptions can easily be cracked.

This is my first real project on Github! Feel free to pull and do with it as you wish. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. (I know my code isn't the most organized lol)
Enjoy my program!
